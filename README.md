## Github API sample usage

Github API offers wide range of operations from creating a repository to every other github actions with Authorization. Create an access token from settings to get started.

I've used cURL to send http requests. It includes:

- Create a new repository
- Update a repository
- Retrieve a repository
- Delete a repository
- Change visibility of a repository
